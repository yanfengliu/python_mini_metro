# Game maturity resume state

Last updated: 2026-07-11

Active goal thread: `019f5286-dfca-75e1-9e79-58719dbe1efb`

Current increment: GM-01 - Make deliveries canonical and repair baseline rules

Current substep: GM-01c - threshold-two behavior and persisted replay compatibility

Current status: GM-01c local implementation, review, and gates complete; stage and inspect Commit A

Durability transaction: GM-01b Commit B is remotely green; GM-01c Commit A is in progress

Last remotely finalized work unit: GM-01b at Commit B `18ef714badc510df044198381d80e22aa3bf0c09`, which passed [run 29177848669](https://github.com/yanfengliu/python_mini_metro/actions/runs/29177848669)

Expected remote implementation baseline: `18ef714badc510df044198381d80e22aa3bf0c09`

Current transaction marker: `[GM-01c:A]`

## Resume here

1. Stage only the GM-01c files listed by iteration `4/diff.md`; preserve the pre-existing untracked `.agents/` directory.
2. Inspect `git diff --cached --stat` and the complete staged diff, then create/push `[GM-01c:A]`.
3. Wait for green pinned CI, create/push `[GM-01c:B]` with exact A evidence, wait for its green CI, then start GM-02.

GM-00a/GM-00b are design/review phases inside the GM-00 transaction; GM-00c/GM-00d are its Commit-A/Commit-B phases and are not independent green work units. Failing TDD tests live only in the working tree inside a work unit and are never remotely finalized red.

Before GM-12c starts, replace its placeholder with one row per configuration and training seed. Before GM-12d starts, add one row per authenticated checkpoint and held-out evaluation seed. Each row gets its own `[<row>:A]` and `[<row>:B]` transaction, exact artifact locator/digests, and remote CI results before the next row begins. The current cursor must name the exact row; directory presence is never completion evidence.

## Known external state

- `main` and `origin/main` were equal at `18ef714badc510df044198381d80e22aa3bf0c09` before GM-01c edits.
- The only pre-existing untracked path is `.agents/`; preserve it.
- The live sibling `../civ-engine` is 2.4.1 while this repository pins 2.2.0, so unisolated local `npm test` fails by design. GM-04 owns the durable setup fix.
- The fleet `loop-ops/DIRECTIVES.md` does not list this repository as an active scheduled shift. Use repo-local persistent state and bare verified passes unless the owner later activates it there.

## Blockers

- None.
