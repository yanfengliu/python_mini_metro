# Game maturity resume state

Last updated: 2026-07-11

Active goal thread: `019f5286-dfca-75e1-9e79-58719dbe1efb`

Current increment: GM-01 - Make deliveries canonical and repair baseline rules

Current substep: GM-01c - threshold-two behavior and persisted replay compatibility

Current status: queued; do not edit GM-01c runtime code until `[GM-01b:B]` CI is green

Durability transaction: GM-01b Commit A is remotely green; this document is GM-01b Commit B awaiting commit/push/CI

Last remotely finalized work unit: GM-01a until `[GM-01b:B]` CI succeeds; GM-01b Commit A `3523ea412a044d3a4c5f3dd43da913c736d78ed9` passed [run 29177705475](https://github.com/yanfengliu/python_mini_metro/actions/runs/29177705475)

Expected remote implementation baseline: `3523ea412a044d3a4c5f3dd43da913c736d78ed9`

Current transaction marker: `[GM-01b:B]`; locate it as the newest `STATE.md` commit with that marker after it is pushed

## Resume here

1. Commit and push this finalization metadata as `[GM-01b:B]` without staging the pre-existing `.agents/`.
2. Locate the pushed B commit by its marker and wait for its GitHub Actions workflow.
3. If B CI fails, reopen GM-01b and repair it. If B CI succeeds, begin GM-01c from the reviewed threshold/replay migration preflight.

GM-00a/GM-00b are design/review phases inside the GM-00 transaction; GM-00c/GM-00d are its Commit-A/Commit-B phases and are not independent green work units. Failing TDD tests live only in the working tree inside a work unit and are never remotely finalized red.

Before GM-12c starts, replace its placeholder with one row per configuration and training seed. Before GM-12d starts, add one row per authenticated checkpoint and held-out evaluation seed. Each row gets its own `[<row>:A]` and `[<row>:B]` transaction, exact artifact locator/digests, and remote CI results before the next row begins. The current cursor must name the exact row; directory presence is never completion evidence.

## Known external state

- `main` and `origin/main` were equal at `6c77033fa2af9d1a1913135f7da3d27b7ff4f2a5` before GM-01b edits.
- The only pre-existing untracked path is `.agents/`; preserve it.
- The live sibling `../civ-engine` is 2.4.1 while this repository pins 2.2.0, so unisolated local `npm test` fails by design. GM-04 owns the durable setup fix.
- The fleet `loop-ops/DIRECTIVES.md` does not list this repository as an active scheduled shift. Use repo-local persistent state and bare verified passes unless the owner later activates it there.

## Blockers

- None.
