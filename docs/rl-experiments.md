# RL experiment ledger

Every experiment run against the pixel task, in order, including the ones that
failed and the ones whose first answer was wrong. A negative result that is
written down is cheaper than the same negative result discovered twice.

Each entry records the hypothesis, what was actually measured, and the verdict.
Verdicts are deliberately blunt: **CONFIRMED**, **REFUTED**, **INVALID** (the
experiment could not answer the question it was asked), or **SUPERSEDED**.

Reference points on Classic, used throughout:

| policy | deliveries |
| --- | --- |
| random | 0 (game over in 364 decisions) |
| scripted expert | ~19-20 |
| trained agent, best so far | 3.75 mean / max 17 |

There is no win condition. `GAME_RULES.md` defines only game over, so the
objective is lifetime passengers delivered before the system is overwhelmed.

## E1 — Is the GPU being used at all?

**Hypothesis:** training is slow because the environment is slow.

**Measured:** `torch.cuda.is_available()` was `False`. The installed build was
`torch 2.13.0+cpu` on a machine with an RTX 4090. A forward+backward pass took
**398.88 ms on CPU against 2.73 ms on CUDA — 146x**.

**Cause:** `requirements-rl-locked.txt` pins a bare `torch==2.13.0`, and PyPI's
Windows wheel is the CPU build; CUDA builds for Windows exist only on
download.pytorch.org. The `sys_platform == 'linux'` markers on the `nvidia-*`
packages are *not* the cause and are not a misdetection — they are correct
guards that Windows rightly skips, and no `nvidia-*` package is installed even
now with CUDA working, because on Windows the CUDA runtime ships inside the
torch wheel.

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED as a real defect. It did **not** move the score, because
the binding constraint was elsewhere (see E4). Fixed by an opt-in CUDA overlay
plus a startup guard that fails when `--device auto` finds no accelerator.

---

## E2 — Does the encoder preserve the resolution it is given?

**Hypothesis:** raising the render profile gives the policy more to see.

**Measured:** it does not. `AdaptiveAvgPool2d((3,5))` collapsed **both** profiles
to an identical 960 values — 192x108 and 320x180 produced byte-identical output
shape. Each pooled cell covered **64x60 px** of a 320x180 frame. Shifting the
whole frame 16 px (1.5 station widths) moved the features **1.79%**, *less* than
a 2 px shift did (1.95%).

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED. The pool was deleted and the flatten sized from the
observation space (960 -> 14,080 at fidelity). Again this did **not** move the
score on its own.

---

## E3 — Fleet allocation as the scripted expert's limiter

**Hypothesis:** the expert scores ~19 because it under-uses locomotives and
carriages.

**Measured:** sweeping locomotives 1 -> 5 and carriages 0 -> 5 moved mean
deliveries **18.0 -> 18.5**.

**Verdict:** REFUTED. Capacity is not what bounds expert play. Games end after
~1000 decisions with only 4 stations ever spawned, so the limiter is upstream of
fleet size.

---

## E4 — Can RecurrentPPO learn this task from scratch?

**Hypothesis:** with the GPU and encoder fixed, PPO will start to learn.

**Measured:** two 3M-step runs (fast and fidelity profiles, seed 42) held
`rollout/ep_rew_mean` at **exactly 0.00 at every logged step**, with
`ep_len_mean` ~330 against random play's 364. Direct probe: across **12 random
episodes and 4,170 decisions, zero built a usable line**. Action-kind frequencies
stayed uniform at ~12.5% each.

**Reasoning:** the reward is not *sparse*, it is **unreachable**. Drawing a line
requires pointer-down on a ~10 px station, motion, then pointer-up on a
*different* station; that ordered sequence essentially never occurs by chance in
a 192x108 coordinate space. With no reward anywhere in a batch the advantage is
identically zero and the policy gradient is the zero vector, so no quantity of
steps, resolution, throughput or capacity changes anything.

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED, and it retroactively explains E1 and E2 producing no
score movement. Both runs were killed rather than left to spin. **Lesson: read a
reward curve before optimising the machinery that produces it.**

---

## E5 — Behaviour cloning from the scripted expert

**Hypothesis:** cloning the expert bootstraps past the exploration barrier.

**Measured:** BC drove `-log_prob` from the uniform **12.019 to 2.350** over
2,042 samples from 30 expert games (mean 19.0 deliveries) — roughly 9.5%
probability on the expert's exact action out of 165,888. The cloned policy
delivered **0**.

Inspecting the policy at the exact step the expert draws separated the halves:
it had learned **when** to act (noop 2.3%, motion/down/up 95%) but not **where**
(argmax x=81 against the expert's 123; `P(expert x)` 0.63% against a 0.52%
uniform).

**Verdict:** PARTIAL. Fitting demonstrations and reproducing them are different
problems. The failure localised to the pointer.

---

## E6 — Is the pointer failure a data limit?

**Hypothesis:** more demonstrations will fix the coordinates.

**Measured:** 80 expert episodes / 3,562 samples reached `-log_prob` 3.255 and
still delivered **0**, as did the tighter-fitting smaller run.

**Verdict:** REFUTED. Not data-limited.

---

## E7 — Flat coordinate head against a spatial heatmap (first attempt)

**Measured:** flat head at **8371x uniform** probability, spatial heatmap at
51.6x — apparently a crushing win for the status quo.

**Verdict:** INVALID. The expert's pointer actions mix two populations: drags
targeting stations, whose coordinates move with the layout, and clicks on fleet
controls, which sit at **fixed UI pixels in every game**. A flat head memorises a
constant trivially, so this measured recall of a constant rather than visual
grounding. The tell was an internal contradiction — 40% probability alongside a
*worse* argmax error than the arm it beat. **Lesson: when two metrics disagree
in direction, the measurement is wrong, not the surprising one.**

---

## E8 — Flat against spatial, station targets only

**Measured**, with UI-control samples excluded:

| head | P(expert x,y) | vs uniform | argmax error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| flat categorical | 0.00924% | 1.9x | 58.5 px |
| spatial heatmap | 0.04603% | 9.5x | 38.1 px |

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED, reversing E7. The flat head is barely above chance at
pointing to a station. Architectural, not data-starved.

---

## E9 — Pointer resolution sweep

**Hypothesis:** a heatmap resampled ~15x from a 7x12 grid cannot resolve a ~10 px
station however well trained, because its finest addressable unit is coarser
than the target.

**Measured:** identical data, encoder, optimiser and 40 epochs, varying only
which encoder depth the heatmap is read from:

| pointer grid | upsample | pointer loss | deliveries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7x12 (depth 6) | 15x | 6.50 | **0.00** |
| 27x48 (depth 2) | 4x | 3.07 | first non-zero |

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED — the single largest effect found before E12. A drag needs
~4 correct pointer actions in sequence, so per-action accuracy compounds, which
is why intermediate improvements showed up as exactly zero rather than partial
credit.

**Correction:** the depth-2 result was first reported as **6.17 mean / max 19**
from 6 evaluation episodes. Twelve held-out episodes gave **1.50 / max 9**.
Episode outcomes are near-bimodal — the drag lands and the run continues, or it
does not and the run dies at the deadline — so a six-episode mean mostly counts
lucky seeds. **Lesson: never report an effect size from a handful of episodes on
a bimodal outcome.**

---

## E10 — The forty-second deadline

**Observed** while debugging E9: every non-delivering policy dies at *exactly*
400 decisions. A decision advances 6 ticks at 60 Hz, so 400 x 0.1 s = **40.0 s**,
which is precisely the over-waiting threshold in `GAME_RULES.md`.

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED as a task characterisation, not a bug. The agent has a
hard 40-second budget to complete its first working drag or the run is over. Any
curriculum or reward shaping has to respect that window.

---

## E11 — Rendering the game at a smaller canvas

**Hypothesis (user's):** the observation is mostly whitespace with sub-pixel
content; render smaller with bigger icons.

**Measured** at the fast profile, confirming the premise exactly:

| entity | canonical | in observation | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| station | 30 px | 3 px | |
| line | 10 px | 1 px | |
| passenger | 5 px | **0.5 px** | sub-pixel |

Ink coverage **3.98%** — 96% of the frame is empty. **Passengers are sub-pixel:
the agent cannot see the objects it is scored on.**

**But 600x800 is impossible.** Every smaller canvas fails a UI layout validator,
including 960x540, 800x600, 600x800 and even 1600x900, and so does 2x entities at
the full canvas. Mechanism: `station_safe_bottom = height * 0.9 + station_size +
margin`, so a shorter surface shrinks the resource-control band while button
sizes stay fixed, and larger stations push down into it — both directions squeeze
the same gap.

Scaling entities instead, with the (now named) `playfield_bottom_ratio` lowered
to buy room:

| entity scale | station | line | passenger | ink |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x1 | 3 px | 1 px | 0.5 px | 3.9% |
| x4 | 12 px | 4 px | 2 px | 10.7% |

**Verdict:** PARTIAL / NOT YET LANDED. Two blockers. Station spawn weights
candidates by `1/(1+distance)` toward the centroid of existing stations with no
size-aware minimum separation, so larger stations spawn **overlapping** (observed
at 3x). And scaling the UI hits a second validator, "resource controls disjoint",
because the horizontal offsets do not scale with the radii.

---

## E12 — Resolution-preserving U-Net against the Nature-DQN stack

**Hypothesis:** choosing where to click is **keypoint localisation**, not
classification. Nature DQN was built for the opposite job — Atari needed
translation *invariance* to pick one of 18 joystick actions, so it strides
position away on purpose, and this repository's variant strides 2 on the third
convolution where the original used stride 1, discarding another 2x. Preserving
resolution end-to-end should beat it.

**Measured**, identical data, loss, optimiser and eval seeds; 12 held-out
episodes:

| arm | params | pointer loss | deterministic | stochastic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| strided | 1,541,705 | 3.127 | 3.08 (max 9) | 0.92 |
| **U-Net** | **450,281** | **0.656** | **3.75 (max 17)** | **3.83 (max 16)** |

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED. Pointer loss 3.127 -> 0.656 is **11.8x** the probability
on the expert's exact pixel, with **3.4x fewer parameters** — preserving
resolution removes the giant flatten-to-linear that dominated the old count.

The stochastic column is the strongest evidence and would be invisible in a mean:
sampling used to cost most of the score (0.92 against 3.08) because a diffuse
heatmap breaks a multi-step drag the moment one coordinate lands wrong; it now
costs nothing (3.83 against 3.75). That is what a genuinely peaked heatmap looks
like, and it matters because PPO samples its actions.

---

## Standing conclusions

1. **Read the reward curve first.** E1 and E2 were real defects that could not
   have moved the score, and were fixed before E4 revealed why.
2. **The reward is unreachable, not sparse.** Any approach must bootstrap
   (cloning, curriculum, or shaped reward) rather than explore.
3. **Pointer precision compounds.** A drag needs ~4 correct coordinates in
   sequence, so partial improvements read as exactly zero until a threshold.
4. **Resolution is destroyed in two independent places** — at render, where a
   passenger is 0.5 px, and in the encoder, which strides it away. Fixing one
   without the other leaves the ceiling in place.
5. **Cloning cannot exceed its teacher.** The scripted expert averages ~19, so
   that is the ceiling of every BC result here. Beating it requires a better
   teacher or genuine RL fine-tuning.
